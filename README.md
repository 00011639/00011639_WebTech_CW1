This website (project) was made for giving full information about the Scoot App. On this website, people read about how to find the nearest available scooter, how much charge it has left and how much it will cost. While visiting the website, they will understand how to unlock the scooter, what kind of purposes scooters should be used for and of course, people can read why it is useful for them to travel by scooters. Users can also easily open the site and find answers to their common questions.

This responsive website consists of two html (home and about) pages, two css (main and main min) and with script js. During writing the codes, there were also used fonts and images.
