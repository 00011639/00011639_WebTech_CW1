Nowadays, air pollution is one of the most leading problems and it requires a serious solution. Huge numbers of cars and traffic jams in the cities are also causing a minor percentage of air pollution. In this project, using scooters rather than cars for small distances was pushed forward to avoid air pollution.

The aim of the project is that anyone who has registered the Scoot App could find an available scooter for him or herself and use it to get the location safe. There would be several scooter parks in the city with chargers and helmets. People would book, scoot off and then they could park it at another nearby scooter park.

The website however, was made for giving full information about the Scoot App. On this website, people read about how to find the nearest available scooter, how much charge it has left and how much it will cost. While visiting the website, they will understand how to unlock the scooter, what kind of purposes scooters should be used for and of course, people can read why it is useful for them to travel by scooters. Users can also easily open the site and find answers to their common questions.

To sum up, this responsive website consists of html pages, css and script js. During writing the codes, there were also used fonts and images. There were not used ready templates, libraries to make the website dynamic and developing the website took roughly 4 days.
